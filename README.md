# Angular1.5-Seed

 There are a few basic examples laid out to understand the structure that was intended, and to put focus on certain limitations that AngularJS has when used in a "forward thinking" way. This is however not a optimal setup but one that caters for the learning curve and conversion from AngularJS to Angular2.

 The project was structured to use a module based approach (separated by functionality) in order to separate concerns providing a clear project layout for both new and experienced developers.
